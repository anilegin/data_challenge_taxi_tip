# data_challenge_taxi_tip
In this project, we analyze a subset of data from the NYC Taxi &amp; Limousine Commission, the objective is to predict the tip amount given to drivers for rides paid with a credit card. We will work on a machine learning model to predict the tipping amount by considering input features.
