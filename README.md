# data_challenge_taxi_tip
In this project, we analyze a subset of data from the NYC Taxi & Limousine Commission, specifically focusing on a subset of data on yellow taxi rides in May 2015. The objective is to predict the tip amount given to drivers for rides paid with a credit card. We will work on a machine learning model to predict the tipping amount by considering input features such as trip distance, fare amount, and passenger numbers. This project is crucial to understanding the factors, including tipping, that can help improve driver satisfaction and service quality.
